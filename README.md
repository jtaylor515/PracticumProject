## Elevator Pitch

Munch is a revolutionary web app that will make searching for a bite to eat easy and enjoyable. With the help of our LLM-powered AI chatbot, you won't have to endlessly scroll through reviews, websites, or the musings of local guides to find the perfect restaurant that fits your needs. Simply tell Munch what you're looking for, and it will provide relevant options near you with a friendly, conversational tone as well as links to make reservations. Munch will save you from stress and hassle, so you can focus on what matters most: good food and good times.

## Features

- **Interactive AI Chatbot**: Get personalized assistance in your search for a meal with our LLM-powered chatbot and restaurant ranking system
